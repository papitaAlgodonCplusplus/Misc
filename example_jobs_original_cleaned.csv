ABOUT USThe OIC workforce development network – 25 affiliates in 19 states - prepares poor people for career success. OIC’s highly successful post-secondary training model was launched by Rev. Leon Sullivan in 1964 to provide excluded African Americans and other poor people with skills to help themselves overcome barriers and achieve prosperity.
Credentialed training, targeted supports, and matching talent with employers is an effective formula for dismantling the harmful effects generational poverty, racial discrimination, and mass incarceration.
Given the enduring labor crisis and a national call to attack inequities and racial injustices, the OIC network is well-positioned to reestablish its prominent role as an agent for economic power and freedom.
The OIC network currently provides technical training, credentialed training, and job placement support for about 4000 people each year. By 2030, the OICA expects to be in 50 communities in 30 states and training 25,000 people annually, including justice involved men and women.",Full-time,"Philadelphia, PA",188,776,ComplexOnsiteApply,Mid-Senior level,0,OIC of America Inc.,"In 1964, Reverend Leon H. Sullivan founded the first OIC training center in an abandoned jailhouse in North Philadelphia.  The dilapidated building was renovated using donations from people in the community and an anonymous grant.  What was once a place of condemnation and restriction had become a place of hope and opportunity, hence the name Opportunity Industrialization Centers (OIC).  OIC provided job and life skills training and matched its graduates with the employment needs of local businesses.  These programs were quickly replicated in cities across the United States providing comprehensive employment training and placement for disadvantaged unskilled Americans of all races. 

Due to the rapid growth of OIC training centers across the country, Rev. Sullivan recognized the need to establish a national headquarters to provide technical assistance to organizations interested in developing an OIC program in their communities.  Therefore, on March 9, 1970, OIC of America, Inc. was incorporated.  Located in Philadelphia, OIC of America serves as a catalyst to aid its affiliates to establish and maintain effective workforce development technologies, reinforce capacity and system-building endeavors, expand partnerships and collaborations, and promote organizational learning and growth through professional development.  The OIC organization has been one of the most productive leaders in vocational training in this country for over 50 years. 

OIC of America Today
As a trusted partner in our communities, we believe in making big impacts. We now run over 150 programs throughout the United States.  Our network of 33 affiliates in 22 states and the District of Columbia represents and supports the underserved.

333,89768356,Fulfillment Manager,"COMPANY OVERVIEW Started 50 years ago by the National Wildlife Federation, Garden for Wildlife™ aims to revolutionize the way people plant, so that—together—we can reverse a declining trend among important backyard wildlife species (think butterflies, birds, bees, and more). It sounds like a lofty goal but it’s actually very doable. The key is to get people to turn their own small piece of Earth—porches, balconies, yards, and gardens—into thriving wildlife habitats by planting native plants. Unfortunately, this solution isn’t well-known and native plants aren’t always easy to find. Insert lightbulb emoji… We work with expert gardeners and scientists to identify the plants that help the highest numbers of wildlife species and we partner with sustainable growers around the country to provide those plants. In spring 2021, we began selling these native plants on our website, GardenforWildlife.com, and we ship directly to our customers’ doorstep in 36 states. Ultimately, we make it easier than ever for anyone—whether a first-timer or the greenest of thumbs—to garden for wildlife and make a real impact. With two gardening seasons under our belt, we’ve empowered and enabled people to create more than 450,000 square feet of new wildlife habitat. And we’re still growing (no pun intended, though we admittedly find these puns hard to avoid)! This year, we’re introducing a one-to-one business model where for every plant sold, we will donate a plant to a community garden or public space—doubling our collective impact and bringing the joy and beauty of nature to even more people.

The AXIUS™ 8mm Needle Driver, a mechanical hand-held articulating laparoscopic device designed for complex and precise suturing, is now registered with the FDA. The Needle Driver is the first of a full suite of AXIUS™ Advanced Laparoscopy devices in the pipeline, which will simplify the most complex surgical tasks.

Unlike traditional laparoscopic needle drivers, AXIUS allows the surgeon to make small articulation and rotational adjustments with just their fingertips. This enables precise needle positioning and delicate movements required for complex reconstructive suturing, while the mechanical design maintains tactile feedback of the tissue. 

It has a minimal learning curve and is easily integrated within standard laparoscopic workflow, allowing the surgeon to remain at the operating room table and in direct contact with the patient. 

The complete AXIUS™ instrument suite will be able to be reprocessed multiple times, providing a cost-effective solution for hospitals to integrate alongside their existing laparoscopic and robotic programs.
